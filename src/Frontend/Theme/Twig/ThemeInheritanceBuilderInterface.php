     * Themes can define the inheritance order for templates. For example, you can define a theme that first loads the templates from your own theme, then from the plugins and finally from the HeyPanel Frontend theme.
     * This Inheritance is built here correctly. The corresponding configuration takes place in the Resources\theme.json. This can look like the following:
     *
     * ```
     *  {
     *      "views": [
     *          "@Frontend,
     *          "@SwagPayPal"
     *          "@Plugins"
     *          "@MyNewTheme"
     *      ],
     *  }
     * ```
     *
     * - @Frontend stands here for the HeyPanel Frontend theme
     * - @SwagPayPal explicitly defines the order in which the PayPal plugin should be considered
     * - @Plugins is a wildcard for all plugins that are not explicitly specified.
     * - @MyNewTheme stands for your own theme, which should be inherited from Frontend.
